Add Location class, Add LocationContains relationship
Event? Multiple locations and times?

custom layouts for sure

PhotoDocument subclasses FileDocument

* deleting items (i.e. blanking)
* remember to fully respect trashed=1 everywhere, like in groups, comments, etc.
* We're going to have to integrate permissions into binary files (e.g., MediaDocument) so that users can't bypass Deme and download things from Apache directly.
* make constraints (validations?) other than uniqueness work in models with revisions (are there any issues?)
* nicer form error handling on IntegrityError (like unique validation failed)
* figure out import deal on deme_django.cms and just cms
* make it work better when you downcast an item in the editor, with versioning backward, and calling actions that should be called on create
* after you comment, and there's a validation error, and you fix it, it doesn't take you back to the original item
* start using verbose_name to have nice displays of item type names
* edit locks
* fyi, there may be cases where there is cur_agent but no cur_account (like anonymous, and login_as other)
* don't forget to update icons for new models
* what happens when viewer2 inherits from viewer1, and viewer2 item type subclasses viewer1 item type, and viewer2 inherits the edit/update functionality?
* add indexes on things besides foreign keys, like description (for search) or version_number, and in global permissions: ability, ability_parameter, and is_allowed fields
* more efficient versioning (like like latest version in db, but have deltas to prev versions)
* SSL for login or just sha1 the password in javascript
* make favicon transparent
* having the default "Item" and "id" ability_parameter is kind of unelegant.
* if you edit an item so it gets downcasted, problems with permissions?
* write a query that finds out all of the people that have permission to do X to item Y
* urls should be more modular, not hard coded as much, like all the /static/media and /resource/{{item_type}}
* decide whether to have autoescape on or off
