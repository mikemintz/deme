* We're going to have to integrate permissions into binary files (e.g., MediaDocument) so that users can't bypass Deme and download things from Apache directly.
* make uniqueness work in models with revisions
* nicer form error handling on IntegrityError (like unique validation failed)
* figure out import deal on deme_django.cms and just cms
* don't forget to the field length hack for 64-bit machines i made in the django trunk
