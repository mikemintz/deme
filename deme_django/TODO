* rename Rev to Version, and version becomes version_number
* add created_at field for Item
* add creator and updater to Item
* every item will now have a name method, that is dynamic, and display that instead of description. description can now be blank.
* We're going to have to integrate permissions into binary files (e.g., MediaDocument) so that users can't bypass Deme and download things from Apache directly.
* make uniqueness work in models with revisions
* nicer form error handling on IntegrityError (like unique validation failed)
* figure out import deal on deme_django.cms and just cms
* don't forget to the field length hack for 64-bit machines i made in the django trunk
* update django version
