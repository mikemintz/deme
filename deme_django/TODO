Add Location class, Add LocationContains relationship
Event? Multiple locations and times?

Symsys things
-------------

NewsRoll 
has many NewsItems

SymsysAffiliate subclasses Person

regular events (copy symsys website)

custom layouts for sure

PhotoDocument subclasses FileDocument

* add module statics to apache config, document it
* deleting items
* We're going to have to integrate permissions into binary files (e.g., MediaDocument) so that users can't bypass Deme and download things from Apache directly.
* make constraints (validations?) other than uniqueness work in models with revisions (are there any issues?)
* nicer form error handling on IntegrityError (like unique validation failed)
* figure out import deal on deme_django.cms and just cms
* don't forget to the field length hack for 64-bit machines i made in the django trunk
* update django version
* make it work better when you downcast an item in the editor, with versioning backward, and calling actions that should be called on create
* after you comment, and there's a validation error, and you fix it, it doesn't take you back to the original item
* start using verbose_name to have nice displays of item type names
* edit locks
* anonymous agent actually seems like better idea now than anonymous account
* don't forget to update icons for new models
