Customizing a Deme Site
-----------------------

After your Deme site is appropriately set up, many components can be easily customized. Be sure to log in as Admin in order to have permission to make many of these changes.

Change the Site Title and Logo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to your current site's settings. By default, your site will be ``Default Site``. Either look for ``Default Site`` using search or, in the footer, click ``Admin > Sites > Default Site``.
2. Your site settings should show that `Site logo` is "None" and `Site title` is blank.
3. Go to ``Actions > Edit`` to change them.

Tips:
  * To add an image logo, click the ... button to choose or upload an image. To upload a new image, click on ``Create a new image document``, then give your image a name, select your image file to upload, and create the image. The popup window will then close and your image's name will show up in the image logo field. Be sure to save for the logo to show up.
  * To edit the title, simply add a title and save.

Edit the Home Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. From the ``Home Page``, click the ``Edit`` button
2. The editor uses TinyMCE as a WYSIWYG editor. After editing, click ``Save HTML document`` to commit your changes.
