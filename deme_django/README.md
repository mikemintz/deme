Installation and usage
----------------------

For documentation on installation and usage, look in the docs/ directory.

The docs are written in reStructuredText using Sphinx, so if you want to view
them properly, you will need to install Sphinx and compile the docs.

To install Sphinx:
 * On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
 * On Mac OS X: sudo easy_install -U Sphinx
 * Other OS: Find out at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

With Sphinx installed, cd to the docs/ directory, and type "make html" to
compile the docs. You'll be able to view the compiled docs starting at
docs/.build/html/index.html

You can also view the documentation online at
