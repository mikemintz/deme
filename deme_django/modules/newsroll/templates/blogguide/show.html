    <h3>Setting up a new Blog</h3>
    <p>So you want to make a blog within Deme? The first and most important part of making a blog is making a new "Site". Sites are items in Deme that allow you to connect a different site with this Deme site. Sites have axcess to all items and content in Deme, but they can specify a different layout. However, apart from viewing items in Deme with a different layout, sites cannot have any other content. </p>
    <p>To make a blog, all that needs to be done is to make a Site with a new default layout and then fill in the content. However, it is required that you have a different domain name (such as www.example.com or www.mywebsite.com), and that you can make it point to {{ host }}. If you can do this (have Mike fill in better instructions), then you can make your blog!</p> 
    <p>To make a new site in Deme, 3 things are required: the hostname of your site, the default layout, and the aliased item. If you have a domain name and it already points to {{ host }}, then the domain name will work as the hostname. 
    <br>Secondly, you have to make the default layout. Search for the "blog template" item, and then make a copy of it, being sure to not modify anything except for the name. This new copy will be your site's default layout.
    <br>Lastly, you have to make the "aliased item". Since were making a blog, this will be a collection of blog entries. Go to make a new collection, set the default viewer to "newsroll", set the item name to the name of your blog, and enter a description of the blog in the Preface box. The Preface will be displayed in the right corner next to the entries of your blog. If you don't want other people to be able to add entries to your blog, be sure to take away everyone else's permission to "modify Membership" in the permissions box. If you want, after creating the entry, you can add a new entry by clicking "Create A New Entry"</p>

    <p>Now you're ready to make a new Site! Go to make a new Site (go to Items - Viewer requests - Sites) and for each field enter in:
    <br>Item Type: the name of your blog
    <br>Preface: leave blank
    <br>Default Viewer: Site
    <br>Viewer: "newsroll" (without the quotes)
    <br>Action: "show" (without the quotes)
    <br>Aliased Item: the name of the collection you made above
    <br>Query String: leave blank
    <br>Format: html
    <br>Hostname: your domain name
    <br>Default Layout: the name of the copy of "blog template" you made above
    <br>Action Summary: leave blank
    <br><br>Once you create this site, you should be able to type in your hostname and go to your brand new blog!
    </p><p></p>

    <h3>Customizing Your Blog</h3>
    <p>Using the blog template, there are a number of customizations you can make, including adding a picture below the title, adding a list of links to the sidebar, and listing the recent posts made to your blog. Of course you are free to modify the template as you wish, but for those that don't know how, the next sections will guide you through everything you can easily do with the blog template.</p>
    <h4>Adding a Picture below the title</h4>
    <p>Adding a picture requires that you first off have a picture stored on your computer. You can use any size picture for your blog, but it looks best if the width of the picture is between 500 and 960 pixels, and the height is between 75 and 150 pixels. In Deme, make a new Image Document (under Items - Documents - File Documents - Image Documents), and upload the picture of your choice from your computer. Heres the tricky part - in the url you should see {{ host }}"/viewing/imagedocument/". After "imagedocument/" you should see a number. Remember this number or write it down, its the image's "primary key", which is a unique identifier. Now, go into the copy of blog template you made while setting up the blog and click the edit button. Search the body for the line that says IMAGE GOES BELOW. In the empty line below that, write (french bracket percent) embed "imagedocument" (the primary key of the image) (percent f.b.)(mike, how do i write out french bracket percent as text?). Now, save the template, and you should be set.</p>
    <h4>Adding Links to the right sidebar</h4> 
    <p>The blog template allows you to embed a collection of links on the right side of the blog. To add links, you first have to make a collection. After you create the collection, you should see {{ host }}"/viewing/collection/" . After "/collection/" you should see a number, write this number down or remember it. This number is the collection's "primary key", a unique numerical identifier. Now, create and add webpages to the collection that you want to be displayed on the side of your blog. Now, go into the copy of the blog template you made while setting up the blog and click the edit button. Search the body for the line that says SIDEBAR TWO, and insert the following line below it: (f.b. p.) embed "blogroll" (the primary key of the collection) (p.f.b.). If you want, you can also type this below the line that says SIDEBAR THREE. SIDEBAR THREE is just the box below SIDEBAR TWO. Now save the template, and you should see the webpages you added to the collection displayed on the side of your blog.    </p> 
    <h4>Listing Recent Posts in the right sidebar</h4>
    <p>The blog template makes it easy to embed a list of the recent posts to the blog. To do so, go to the original collection that you made when you were setting up your blog. It should be a list of your entries, and in the url you should see {{ host }}"/viewing/newsroll/". After "/newsroll/", you should see a number. Write this number down or remember it. This number is the item's "primary key", a unique identifier. Now, go to the copy of the blog template you made while setting up your blog, click edit, and search for the line that says SIDEBAR THREE (if you want to put this in the box above the bottom, go to the line that says SIDEBAR TWO). Below this line, enter the following line (f.b.p.) embed "blogpost" (primary key of the collection) (p.f.b.). Now save the template, and you should see a listing of the recent posts on the right.</p>

    <h3>Adding Entries</h3>
    <p>Adding entries to your blog is fairly simple. Go back to the original collection you made when you were setting up your blog, and select "Create A New Entry". </p>
