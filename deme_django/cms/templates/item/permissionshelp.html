  <p>Permissions in Deme control what users can see and do. If you are authorized, you can give other users permission to perform actions or take permissions away.</p>
  <h3>Permissions Example</h3>
  <p>Let's say you're making a <a href="{% url 'item_type_url' viewer='textdocument' action='new' %}">new text document</a> and don't want anyone to see it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></i> <b>Permissions</b> on the item.</li>
    <li>Under "Everyone", create a <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit"></i> <b>New Permission</b>.</li>
    <li>From the new permission's dropdown menu, choose the "Do Anything" permission.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>- Minus sign</b> to make it a negative permission. This means that "Everyone" <b>can not</b> "Do Anything", hence won't be able to view, edit, etc our new item.</li>
    <li>Save your document. Since only you have the ability to "Do Anything" on the item, other users won't be able to see it, with the exception of the Admin.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now let's say you want to show it to just one other person, Jane.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the item <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></i> <b>Permissions</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-profile"></i> <b>Assign a Permission to a User</b>.</li>
    <li>In the popup, find Jane and add her.</li>
    <li>Go ahead and <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-th-list"></i> <b>Show All</b> permissions, and click the <b>+ Plus sign</b> next to the ones necessary to show the text document, namely "View anything" and "Comment on".</li>
    <li>Save your document and now Jane will be able to view and comment on it.</li>
  </ol>

<!--


    <p>Permissions in Deme are very powerful and can be extremely useful. If you are authorized,
    you can both give other users permission to perform actions and take away other users' permissions.</p>
To better illustrate how permissions work, consider this following example:
Joe is making a new document, and he wants no one except Mike to be able to read it or even know that it exists.
Joe only wants Mike to be able to view the document and comment on it.
<br>The first thing he does is take away everyone's permission to do anything. He does this
by clicking "New Permission" across from "Everyone", going to "Do anything" in the drop-down menu,
and then unchecking the box next to the permission, which signifies that "Everyone" <b>cannot</b> "do anything".
<img src="{% media_url 'permissionshelp/help1.png' %}" alt="help1" style="border: thin solid #000;"/><br>
Keep in mind that the "do anything" permission is the ability to do everything else on the drop-down list
of permissions. Now, no one except Joe has permission to do anything, which means they cannot
view the document's body, nor edit the document, etc. <br>
Now, Joe wants to allow Mike to view the document. So, Joe clicks on the "Select Agent" button, types in "mike",
and then selects Mike from the drop-down menu.<br>
<img src="{% media_url 'permissionshelp/help2.png' %}" alt="help1" style="border: thin solid #000;"/><br>
 He then gives Mike the ability to "view body", "view item name",
and "comment on" the document, by clicking the "New Permission" link across from Mike and selecting the appropriate permission from the drop-down
menu.
<img src="{% media_url 'permissionshelp/help3.png' %}" alt="help1" style="border: thin solid #000;"/><br>
Only Mike and Joe can now view the document. This is because individual permissions, which are permissions
that only apply to one person, override permissions that apply to everyone. This is why Mike can view the document,
but everyone else cannot. <br> <br>
<p>-->
<p>You can also give a Collection of users permission to do something. Keep in mind that collection-wide permissions
override permissions that apply to everyone, but individual permissions still over-ride Collection-wide permissions.
To give a collection of users special permissions, simply click "Select Collection", select the desired collection
of users, and then give the collection the desired permissions.
